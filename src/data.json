        "At some or the other point of your life, you must have had an experience in editing pictures on your phone that would have included simple operations , like converting your image from RGB to B/W, or increasing/decreasing contrast, or brightness enhancement, or noise reduction or maybe an auto edit feature. While being able to perform all these operations on your phone in a jiff, have you ever wondered digging into the fascinating technicalities behind it? ",
        "A similar palatable thought of being able to perform them on our desktop using codes and algorithms is what gave birth to the idea of formation of this club. The founders were looking for an idea to bring like-minded people, having similar passion and enthusiasm , together under one roof, to dive deeper into the world of Digital Image processing, which gave birth to the AGPI club.",
        "Amity Digital Imaging & Processing Club is a tech club in Amity School of Engineering and Technology which primarily focuses on fields like Computer Graphics, Digital Imaging and processing. The club was founded by Dr. Deepak Gaur and Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Tomar in June 2020. The club organises events and webinars that emphasizes on burgeoning sophomoresâ€™ interest in Digital Imaging and also focuses on providing a better platform to the summit-minds in the field."
